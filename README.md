# Air Monitoring System using ESP32, Air Sensor, and Firebase

![Project Image](link_to_project_image.jpg)

This project aims to create an air monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller, an air sensor, and Firebase for data storage and retrieval. The system continuously measures air quality parameters and sends this data to a Firebase database for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Components Used

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Air quality sensor
- Firebase for data storage

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of air quality parameters.
- Firebase integration for data storage and retrieval.
- Continuous data transmission and logging.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up the ESP32 development environment.
3. Install the necessary libraries, including the Firebase Arduino Client Library for ESP8266 and ESP32 by Mobizt.

## Usage

1. Connect the air sensor to the ESP32 following the provided schematic.
2. Configure the ESP32 to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
3. Update the Firebase credentials in the code.
4. Upload the code to the ESP32.
5. Power on the system and monitor air quality data on Firebase.

## Firebase Arduino Client Library

This project utilizes the Firebase Arduino Client Library for ESP8266 and ESP32 by Mobizt. Find the library and installation instructions [here](link_to_library).

## Project Status

This project is still a work in progress. Current functionalities include data transmission to Firebase. Future updates may include additional features and improvements to enhance the system's functionality and usability.
